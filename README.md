Below you find a short history about my experience with coding and some projects I worked on.
Of course I didn't list every project, small projects like making a calculator in Lua are not listed on here.

*Last update was on November 25th - 2020* 

## **History**

**13 years old** - I started making my own small games on a platform called Roblox, the engine uses Lua which has some really readable syntax supporting **and** instead of **&&** etc.

**14 years old** - I worked on a game with the idea being parkour mixed up with reflections, sometimes platforms would be invisible, but if you looked in the mirror they were visible, this project however ended up being to big for a solo developer and I lost interest in it.

**15 years old** - I got some lessons in C#, HTML and CSS, this was however really basic, I started making an application called ExSploits with C# at home. This application allowed me to run Lua scripts within other Roblox games, thus being able to change stuff in other games.

**16 years old** - Started working on Boosty, a Discord bot, started small, got bigger really fast

**17 years old** - Started multiple projects, a Discord music bot, a Minecraft server, a website for that server and a Discord bot which converts timezones

**68 years old** - Proud boomer

## **My Projects**

### **Boosty <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Exhabition/Exhabition/main/boosty.png" alt="Boosty" width="30"/>**

Started as a simple bot which would just react to certain message, slowly over time became bigger and bigger, now it's a complete moderation bot containing moderator commands, but also some fun commands, welcome messages, polls, server stats and a fully working level system. All data is being save to a mySQL database.

Has access to Reddit and won't hesitate to grab some memes from there, also watches Twitch to see if the server owner goes live.

Although this bot is private and can't be invited to your own server, you can test it out in the main server: [Discord](https://discord.gg/JUZ6KHK).

**Used** 
 * Javascript
 * Node.js
 * Discord.js
 * MySQL
 * MongoDB

**THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION IS A PROJECT WHICH STILL NEEDS TWEAKING AND ISN'T FINISHED, SOME MENTIONED FEATURES HAVENT BEEN PUBLISHED YET**

After getting better with overall coding a Discord bot because of my experience with Boosty, I started to make a music bot, which is a bit harder then a messages only bot. 
I started streaming making the bot on [Twitch](http://twitch.miney.net) where people asked if I was going to make the bot public. After some time I got the idea to make this the most customizable music bot out there. 

Custom profile image, custom base name, a status displaying the current song if the bot is playing, easily changable permissions etc. 
This wouldn't be possible if I did it the easy way and that's why I decided to make it premium only, to keep the quality.

Made a system where you can subscribe to 3 different tiers with [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) and linked that with the bot, this is my most fun project I have had so far.

Classy supports multiple platforms like Spotify, Deezer, Tidal, SoundCloud and more...
