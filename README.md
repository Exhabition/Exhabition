## **My Projects**

### **Boosty <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Exhabition/Exhabition/main/boosty.png" alt="Boosty" width="30"/>**

Started as a simple bot which would just react to certain message, slowly over time became bigger and bigger, now it's a complete moderation bot containing moderator commands, but also some fun commands, welcome messages, polls, server stats and a fully working level system. All data is being save to a mySQL database.

Has access to Reddit and won't hesitate to grab some memes from there, also watches Twitch to see if the server owner goes live.

Although this bot is private and can't be invited to your own server, you can test it out in the main server: [Discord](https://discord.gg/JUZ6KHK).

**Used** 
 * Javascript
 * Node.js
 * Discord.js
 * MySQL
 * MongoDB

### **Miney <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Exhabition/Exhabition/main/miney.png" alt="Miney" width="30"/>**

Discord bot which mainly gets stats from the Minecraft and one of the biggests servers, Hypixel. 
While making Miney, I learned a lot about API requests and rate limits, I also did work on some image generation.

More info about Miney can be found on here: https://top.gg/bot/780020541117038592

### **Classy <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Exhabition/Exhabition/main/classy.png" alt="Classy" width="30"/>**

**THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION IS A PROJECT WHICH STILL NEEDS TWEAKING AND ISN'T FINISHED, SOME MENTIONED FEATURES HAVENT BEEN PUBLISHED YET**

After getting better with overall coding a Discord bot because of my experience with Boosty, I started to make a music bot, which is a bit harder then a messages only bot. 
I started streaming making the bot on [Twitch](http://twitch.miney.net) where people asked if I was going to make the bot public. After some time I got the idea to make this the most customizable music bot out there. 

Custom profile image, custom base name, a status displaying the current song if the bot is playing, easily changable permissions etc. 
This wouldn't be possible if I did it the easy way and that's why I decided to make it premium only, to keep the quality.

Made a system where you can subscribe to 3 different tiers with [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) and linked that with the bot, this is my most fun project I have had so far.

Classy supports multiple platforms like Spotify, Deezer, Tidal, SoundCloud and more...
